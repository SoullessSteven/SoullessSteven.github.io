<h2>Spotifty Remake</h2>
	<img src="Artifacts/LogoMaker.png" width="400.5" height="214.5" alt=""/>
	
<h2>Spotify Description</h2>
	<h3>We had to think of a logo to duplicate when creating this, so I choose the Spotify logo because it's the app I use the most throughout the day because I like music. </h3>
	
<h2>"On My Block" Art</h2>
<img src="Artifacts/OnMyBlock.png" width="400" height="333" alt=""/>
	
<h2>"On My Block" Description"</h2>
	<h3>We were instructed to create a tiny block and add any buildings or other items that we want. I decided to put a gamestop and a few other random structures because I enjoy playing video games.</h3>
	
<h2>Blur Blur Wolf</h2>
<img src="Artifacts/Wolf.png" width="350" height="339.5" alt=""/>
	<h2>Wolf Description</h2>
	<h3>We created this at the beginning of the school year while playing about with the Adobe settings, and I ended up creating what I like to refer to as blur blur wolf.</h3>
	
<h2>Pikachu Tessellations</h2>
<img src="Artifacts/Pikachu.png" width="534" height="446" alt=""/>
	<h2>Pikachu Description</h2>
	<h3>This is one of my favorite pieces of art; I spent more time on it than any other because I didn't want the vision in my brain to go away, so I needed to finish it quickly while it was still fresh in my memory.</h3>
	
<h2>Emoji Recreation</h2>
<img src="Artifacts/Emoji Recreate.png" width="300" height="300" alt=""/>
	<h2>Emoji Description</h2>
	<h3>I choose this emoji because it reflects how I behave when playing video games at home when we were simply recreating emojis.</h3>
